Printed title delivery system

The pydelivery package aims to provide a easy to use system for, mostly small newsagents, who provide deliveries of newspapers, magazines, and other such publications to both individual households and residential premises whilst maintaining all the relevant information pertient to organising that delivery.

There is an apparent lack of products in this particular area of the market, which by observations, is a decreasing area, with most publications being made available online without a related printed publication.  Those that exist are part of an printed publication organisation's exisitng business accounting system, and as such produces invoices and dailys as a by-product.

There are a number of objectives to be achieved by the pydelivery package, one is it provide an itenerary of the titles to be delivered on a weekly basis, one is it provide the numbers of titles that are need on each round, and the other is to provide a means to offer short term alterations to the delivery information provided.

The pydelivery package does not aim to replace or replicate an invoicing system as there can be issues arising from accounting practices based on a purely open source aid packages.
